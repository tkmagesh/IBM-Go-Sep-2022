Why Go (2010) ?
    1. Close to hardware
    2. Simplicity
        - Only 25 keywords
        - No access modifiers (public, private, protected etc)
        - No class construct (only structs)
        - No inheritence (only composition)
        - No exceptions (only errors)
        - No reference types (everything is a value)
        - No pointer arithmetic (unlike C & C++)
        - No implicit type conversion
    3. Concurrency (ability to have more than one execution path)
        - Concurrency is a "language" feature (Goroutines)
        - Scheduler is built in the application's compiled binary
        - Language features :
            go, chan (data type), <- (chan operator), range construct, select construct
        - APIs
            sync package
            sync/atomic package

Paradox of Choice (Barry Shwartz)

Running a go program
    go run <program.go>

Creating a build
    go build <program.go>

Data Types
    bool
    string

    int
    int8
    int16
    int32
    int64

    uint
    uint8
    uint16
    uint32
    uint64

    float32
    float64

    complex64 (real[float32] imaginary[float32])
    complex128 (real[float64] imaginary[float64])

    byte (alias for uint8)
    rune (alias for int32) (unicode code point)
